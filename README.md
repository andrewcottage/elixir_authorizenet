AuthorizeNet
============

This is WIP.

## Errors

These errors are might be raised by the API calls:

 * [AuthorizeNet.Error.Connection](https://github.com/marcelog/elixir_authorizenet/blob/master/lib/elixir_authorizenet/error/connection_error.ex): There was an error when trying to hit the API endpoint (like a network issue).

 * [AuthorizeNet.Error.Request](https://github.com/marcelog/elixir_authorizenet/blob/master/lib/elixir_authorizenet/error/request_error.ex): The request was sent and received by the server, but it returned a status different than 200.

 * [AuthorizeNet.Error.Operation](https://github.com/marcelog/elixir_authorizenet/blob/master/lib/elixir_authorizenet/error/operation_error.ex): The request was sent and received successfully, a status 200 was returned by the server, but there was an error when trying to process the operation.
